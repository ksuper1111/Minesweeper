# Minesweeper
This is a Small Minesweeper Game 
Minesweeper

A simple clone of the classic Minesweeper game, built in Java.
This project was developed as part of my coursework at the University of Vermont to strengthen my skills in object-oriented programming, user interaction handling, and basic algorithm design.

Features

Randomized mine placement
Adjustable board size and mine count (if you added that)
Win and loss detection
User input validation
Display of revealed and hidden cells
Basic text-based user interface (if itâ€™s console-based)
How to Run

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Minesweeper.git
cd Minesweeper
Compile the code:
javac Minesweeper.java
Run the program:
java Minesweeper
Note: Make sure you have Java installed (version 8 or higher).
If your code is split into multiple files (like Board.java, Cell.java), just compile all .java files at once with javac *.java.

Future Improvements

Add a graphical user interface (GUI) using JavaFX or Swing
Add a timer and score tracker
Implement different difficulty levels
Add flagging functionality (right-click to flag suspected mines)
